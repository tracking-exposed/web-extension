# Working with i18n

Check the [official docs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/i18n). This is important
if you are developing under Linux:

> to change the locale on Linux, first quit Google Chrome. Then, all in one line, set the LANGUAGE environment variable and launch Google Chrome. For example:

```
LANGUAGE=es ./chrome
```


# Accepted locales

Refer to the [locales support](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n?csw=1#localeTable) page
in the official Chrome documentation.
