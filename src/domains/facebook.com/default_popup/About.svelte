<h2>About Facebook Tracking Exposed</h2>
<p>
  Dear friend, thanks for supporting the facebook.tracking.exposed initiative.
</p>
<p>
  We care a lot about your privacy and we want to be as transparent as possible,
  that's why:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The extension collects only <strong>public posts</strong>. For clarity,
    each post in your newsfeed is enriched with a header showing its
    visibility.
  </li>

  <li>
    We have a
    <a href="https://facebook.tracking.exposed/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Statement</a>
    that describes what data we collect, and why.
  </li>

  <li>
    We release only
    <a href="https://github.com/tracking-exposed/" target="_blank">free, open source code</a>
    everyone can audit.
  </li>
</ul>
